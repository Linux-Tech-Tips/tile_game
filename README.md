# Terminal Emulator Tile Reduction Game System

This software, called the Terminal Emulator Tile Reduction Game System (otherwise known as TETRGS), is a game, based on the ideas of the popular video game series Tetris. The game field is a grid, with blocks constructed of Tiles, falling downwards, in which the player's task is to Reduce lines of fallen Tiles to gain score.

The game is developed in pure C, using only the Linux C standard library, and is developed and tested on Linux terminals.

The game is still work in progress, and while a working demo is available, everything is still subject to change.

To try out the demo, clone the repository on a Linux machine with *gcc* and *make* installed, and execute *make run* in a sufficiently large terminal.

## TODO
